FindEpoxy
---------

Find the Epoxy (*libepoxy*) headers and library.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Epoxy::Epoxy``
  The Epoxy library, if found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will define the following variables in your project:

``Epoxy_FOUND``
  true if (the requested version of) Epoxy is available.
``Epoxy_VERSION``
  the version of Epoxy; only defined when a ``pkg-config`` module for
  Epoxy is available.
``Epoxy_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use Epoxy.
``Epoxy_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find the Epoxy headers.
``Epoxy_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  this should be passed to target_compile_options(), if the
  target is not used for linking
